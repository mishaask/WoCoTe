# WorkConnect

WorkConnect is a mobile application designed to centralize and simplify all communication and daily actions between employees and employers in one single place.  
The app replaces scattered WhatsApp messages and manual coordination by gathering everything into one organized platform.

WorkConnect allows both sides to manage things like tasks, internal chat, attendance, shifts, availability, vacation requests all in one app.
